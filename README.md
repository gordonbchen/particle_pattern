# particle_pattern
Creating patterns with particle simulations.

Simulates 2D elastic collisions between equal-mass and equal-sized particles. Particle positions can be initialized by drawing, from the edges of a given image (convolutional edge detector), or randomly. Simulation can be run in interactive game mode, where the user can reverse time and pause, or as an animation creator.

## Basic Usage
* Requires `python3` and `poetry`
* Install requirements and activate shell with `poetry`
* Run `python3 particle_pattern/run_sim.py`. This will start up a `pygame` window allowing you to place particles by drawing. Hit ENTER when done. An animation of seemingly randomly placed particles colliding and making your drawing will be saved to `outputs`.
* For other options and more advanced usage, run `python3 particle_pattern/run_sim.py --help` and read the code.
